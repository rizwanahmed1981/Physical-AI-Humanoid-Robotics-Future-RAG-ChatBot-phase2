  "description": "In Chapter 1, we explored the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. Now we dive into the practical infrastructure that enables these concepts to come to life: the Robot Operating System 2, or ROS 2. Just as our biological nervous system coordinates our body's responses, ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for modern robots, orchestrating communication between sensors, actuators, and control systems.",
