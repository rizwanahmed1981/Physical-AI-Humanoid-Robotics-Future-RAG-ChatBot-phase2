### Quiz: Simulated Humanoid Robot Demonstration

1. What is the first step in the robot's workflow when receiving a voice command?
   - Vision and object recognition
   - Human interaction
   - Planning and reasoning
   - Control and actuation

2. What does the system do with the command "Please bring me the blue book from the living room table"?
   - Only identifies the color blue
   - Extracts intent and identifies object and location
   - Only locates the table
   - Only grasps the book

3. What is the role of vision in the demonstration?
   - Only processes language
   - Identifies objects and locations in the environment
   - Controls actuators
   - Plans actions

4. What is one key component of the planning phase?
   - Only motor control
   - Task decomposition and step planning
   - Only visual recognition
   - Only sensor feedback

5. What happens during the feedback and adaptation phase?
   - Only executes actions
   - Sensors monitor results and adjust the system
   - Only processes language
   - Only plans future actions

6. What is the primary benefit of the complete workflow demonstration?
   - It makes robots more expensive
   - It shows how all concepts work together
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

7. What does the demonstration showcase about the system?
   - Only basic programming concepts
   - How all textbook components work together
   - Only the limitations of humanoid robots
   - Only the cost of robotics

8. What is one key aspect of the scenario walkthrough?
   - Only motor control
   - Natural language command processing
   - Only visual recognition
   - Only planning

9. What is the role of the planning phase in the demonstration?
   - Only controls actuators
   - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps
   - Only processes language
   - Only recognizes objects

10. What does the feedback mechanism enable?
    - Only visual recognition
    - Continuous adaptation and improvement
    - Only language processing
    - Only planning
