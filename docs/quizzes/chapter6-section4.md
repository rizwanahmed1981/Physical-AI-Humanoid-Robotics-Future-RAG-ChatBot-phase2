### Quiz: Safety and Constraints in Practice

1. What is one key safety measure implemented in the capstone system?
   - Only visual recognition
   - Collision avoidance
   - Only language processing
   - Only planning

2. What is the primary purpose of constraint management?
   - To make robots slower
   - To balance competing requirements like performance vs safety
   - To eliminate all constraints
   - To reduce robot capabilities

3. What does fail-safe operation mean?
   - It makes robots less reliable
   - It enables graceful handling of unexpected situations
   - It eliminates the need for planning
   - It reduces robot capabilities

4. What is one practical safety measure for the simulated robot?
   - Only speed control
   - Force limiting to prevent excessive force
   - Only visual sensors
   - Only audio sensors

5. What is the significance of emergency stop capability?
   - It makes robots slower
   - It provides immediate shutdown capability for safety
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

6. What is one key benefit of safety considerations?
   - It makes robots more expensive
   - It ensures reliable operation in real-world conditions
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

7. What does constraint management balance?
   - Only performance
   - Performance vs safety, precision vs speed, and resource efficiency
   - Only visual sensors
   - Only language processing

8. What is the role of error detection in safety?
   - It makes robots slower
   - It identifies when plans fail or actions don't complete
   - It eliminates the need for planning
   - It reduces robot capabilities

9. What is one limitation of safety measures?
   - Perfect real-world replication
   - Real-world complexity in simulations
   - Only visual sensors
   - Only language processing

10. What is the significance of acknowledging safety constraints?
    - It makes robots less capable
    - It helps identify areas for improvement
    - It eliminates the need for sensors
    - It reduces robot capabilities
