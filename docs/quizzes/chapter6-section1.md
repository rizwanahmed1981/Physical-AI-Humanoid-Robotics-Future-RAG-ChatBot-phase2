### Quiz: System Architecture Overview

1. What are the nine main components of the Physical AI stack?
   - Human interaction, vision, VLA layer, planning, AI brain, ROS 2, control, sensors, simulation
   - Only sensors and actuators
   - Only planning and control
   - Only language and vision

2. What is the core operating cycle of the humanoid robot system?
   - Planning → Action → Feedback → Perception
   - Perception → Planning → Action → Feedback
   - Action → Perception → Planning → Feedback
   - Feedback → Planning → Action → Perception

3. What role does ROS 2 play in the system?
   - Only controls actuators
   - Serves as the communication backbone for all major components
   - Only handles language processing
   - Only manages vision systems

4. What is the purpose of the perception-action loop?
   - To make robots slower
   - To enable continuous adaptation and improvement
   - To eliminate the need for planning
   - To reduce robot capabilities

5. What is the significance of the complete system integration?
   - It makes robots more expensive
   - It demonstrates how all components work together for intelligent behavior
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

6. What is one key benefit of the integrated approach?
   - It makes robots slower
   - It enables robots to understand human intent and respond appropriately
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

7. What does the capstone project demonstrate about system components?
   - They operate independently
   - They integrate to create intelligent physical behavior
   - They are contradictory
   - They are irrelevant

8. What is one limitation of the system architecture?
   - Perfect real-world replication
   - Real-world complexity in simulations
   - Only visual sensors
   - Only language processing

9. What is one benefit of understanding the complete architecture?
   - It makes robots less capable
   - It provides insight into system design principles
   - It eliminates the need for sensors
   - It reduces robot capabilities

10. What is the role of simulation in the system?
    - Only real-world testing
    - Safe testing of perception, planning, and control systems
    - Only visual recognition
    - Only language processing
