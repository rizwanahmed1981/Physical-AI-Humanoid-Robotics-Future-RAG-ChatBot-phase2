7. What is the significance of understanding future directions?
   - It makes robots slower
   - It guides continued research and development
   - It eliminates the need for safety
   - It reduces robot capabilities

8. What does the capstone project demonstrate about the relationship between concepts?
   - They operate independently
   - They integrate to create intelligent physical behavior
   - They are contradictory
   - They are irrelevant

9. What role does ROS 2 play in the integrated system?
   - Only handles visual processing
   - Provides the communication backbone for all components
   - Only manages language understanding
   - Only coordinates planning

10. What is one key outcome of completing this capstone project?
